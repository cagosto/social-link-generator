<h1>Social media tool for sharing content to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Email</h1>

<p>So this not a plugin. This is a tool that gives you a function that you can call in order to share on most social media sites. Such as Facebook, Twitter, Email and Pinterest. This tool was created to solve a very simple problem of always having to make pop window to share stuff on social media sites. This tool will write all the code you need in order to create a social media pop for your site.</p>

<p>The current method used for sharing for Facebook is an app share. Which use a Facebook App Id. This allows you not to have to use the Facebook SDK to do a share to Facebook and also has the added benefit of being able to have more than one share on the same page. Some add benefits to this tool is that it allows for some formating. For example if you want a line break in an email you can do that in the message area. It will URLencode and charted in the message or subject copy. Twitter has an options for adding hashtags and urls to your tweet and pinterest has all the standard options such as images, message, and links.</p>
